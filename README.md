# radioifier

converts an inputted .mp3 file into a converted .mp3 file that sounds like a radio

syntax

python3 radioifier.py --input_file input.mp3 --cutoff_low 1000 --cutoff_high 4500

mess around with the cutoff_low and cutoff_high parameters to get different sounds

you may use the argument --skip-mp3 if you wish to not convert to mp3 and leave as an uncompressed .wav file.

happy radio-ing!
